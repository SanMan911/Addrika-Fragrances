# Addrika E-Commerce Platform - PRD

## Original Problem Statement
Build a premium e-commerce platform for Addrika natural incense brand by Centsibl Traders. Features include product catalog, user auth, admin portal, retailer dashboard, SEO, and messaging consistency enforcement.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router) at `/app/frontend-next`
- **Backend**: FastAPI with MongoDB at `/app/backend`
- **Payments**: Razorpay
- **Email**: Resend
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend) + Render (backend)

## Messaging Consistency Rules (CRITICAL)
1. **Smoke Reduction**: "60%+" or "over 60% less smoke". Never 40%, 80%.
2. **Bamboo**: ONLY Dhoop is bambooless. Agarbattis have bamboo.
3. **Ingredients**: "Ethical Sourcing" — NOT "100% natural".
4. **Tree Donation**: Strictly ₹5 customer + ₹5 Addrika match.
5. **Burn Time**: Do NOT show burn time for Bakhoor products.
